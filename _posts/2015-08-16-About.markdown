# About
**doctorbatch.io** has finally arrived: <a href="https://github.com/zblservices/doctorbatch.io">Find it on GitHub!</a>

**doctorbatch.io** is an API for developing batch applications in the Java programming language targetted for deployment to IBM's WebSphere Batch or WebSphere Liberty Profile's Java EE Batch runtime environments. The <b>doctorbatch.io</b> provides portability between the two runtimes by abstracting application development away from the runtime-specific API, and providing adapters for deployment.
